In this project, we translated the replication package of Bazzi (2017) from Stata to replicate the results in table 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
You could download the entire Replication_Package repo and then change line 26 in Master_Script.R to your download location to run our programme in R. 
The master script calls for the script for each table separately. You could also run the preamble to set up the environment and functions to replicate the tables separately.
We have included the dataset provided by the author in our package, as well as the original Stata code from the author.
